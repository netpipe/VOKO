WIP token system with batch verification for added security, can function as IOU's , vouchers or digital notes or weighted votes even.

if you want to use multiple versions you'll probably want a shell script for moving the database in applications app folder

reopen application or wait 50000 ms to redeem expired token files.

to use , generate all tokens button then select valid tokens ( basically grabs random tokens from initial generated ones) , after that you dont have to use those buttons unless generating a new one. exporting tokens and importing them after that with the buttons.

backing things up is easy /Applications/VOKO.app/Contents/Macos/tokens.db
